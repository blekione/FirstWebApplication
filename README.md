# FirstWebApplication

My personal project where my aim is to learn developing web application with Java EE (Spring framework in later stage).

The idea came up from simple challenge I found on reddit, which asked to input some data (user name, age and nickname) and display it back on the screen. To simple for me, but I try to make it more challenging by creating web application to complete this challenge and then extend it by adding new features (save user data into file - later into database, adding pictures).
